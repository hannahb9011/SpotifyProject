# Spotify Project

The analyzed information is then saved into a text file. Using a webservice, the file can then be accessed and printed to the screen when a button is pressed by the user.

top_music_spotify.csv shows the data that was uploaded to the HDFS and refered to as spotifyData in spark_spotify.py.
